***Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion***

```first draft
In the world of science and technology, following trends by choosing major or courses to take that benefits us in the future seems to be a sensible decision. While so many students thesedays opt for these high-fashion, easy to pick curriculums, others want to take it differently. Indeed, studying whatever of your interest may in long term bring us much fruitful success and life-long happiness. 
On one hand,  students taking courses that are realistic for future demands can have several advantages. First, being a student with related knowledge in high demanding fields means significant impacts and open chances to get a well-paid job. For example, graduated learners with a bachelor degree in technology or computer science nowadays have real good salaries because of their good qualities and the need for equivalent positions in many tech corporations. Moreover, cultivated skills and experiences cummulated from studying these subjects may be helpful for real life situations due to the practical traits they may embrace. However, many people have also been struggling terribly to get by their colleges's days when these complusory courses dominate them all. Lacking of interests, the students taking hours of studying that boring lessons become demotivated and miserable no matter how important and vital it may bring. Even more, those subjects tend to be abstract and somewhat incomprehensive, posing a real challenge for anyone without a proper care and preparation throughout university's years. If they keep staying and being content with where they are, valuable time and money will be wasted. Therefore, courses like this should never be our first prioritized consideration. 
On the other hand, with freedom and priviledges to take whatever majors we are fond of, life at university will be much more enjoyable and happy. First, these majors with more independent and customary characteristics may not be practical sometimes, but often yield good outcome eventually. For instance, some subjects such as arts or culture study can get less attention from the public which in turn force us to face with difficulties in finding, searching for good materials or academic resources. Moreover, jobs involved with our actual liking subjects can be hard to find or even earn no income. Nonetheless, learning subjects that we all like makes the process enjoyable and appealing. As a result, studying whatever boosts our mood up or with high motivation smooths our understanding about the gist of the subject and usually comes with efficiency. Last but not least, with personal selection being well respected, students picking these majors overcome tests and exams with less stressful and more relaxing feelings which makes them happier. Therefore, freedom in deciding what to learn at university may seem to be a better option. 
Although several benefits can drive us to "go with the flow" and making decisions based on current trends. Pusueing independence and freedom even in chosing major can mean a significant deal for our futures. Learning is a long journey, so anyone should not make it regretable by choosing what others like.

### Comment by chatGPT
  
Overall, your essay presents a thoughtful exploration of the topic, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of choosing practical, future-oriented courses versus following personal interests at university. However, there are some areas that could be improved for better clarity and coherence.

Firstly, there are minor **grammatical issues** in your essay, such as the use of articles ("a" or "an") and word choices. For example, it should be "a major" instead of "a major," and "benefit us" rather than "benefit" in the opening sentence. Additionally, consider **rephrasing "easy-to-pick" for better clarity.**

The examples you provide are relevant and effective in supporting your points. However, it would be beneficial to **add more details and specific examples to enhance the persuasiveness** of your arguments. For instance, when discussing the advantages of practical courses, you could provide specific data or statistics on job placement and salaries in technology or computer science fields.

In the second paragraph, be cautious with **expressions like "really good salaries" and "real-life situations," as they may come across as informal.** Consider using more precise language and academic expressions to **maintain a formal tone**.

The essay **lacks a clear thesis statement** that explicitly **states your position on the issue**. Including a strong thesis at the end of the introduction will provide a roadmap for the reader and make your stance more evident. Additionally, **each paragraph should begin with a clear topic sentence to guide the reader** through the essay's structure.

In the conclusion, it is important to **restate your main points and reiterate your position**. **The phrase "go with the flow" could be replaced with more formal language**, and consider providing a more definitive stance on whether one approach is better than the other.

Overall, your essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but refining grammar, providing more detailed examples, and strengthening your thesis statement will enhance its overall effectiveness.

In the landscape of higher education, the ongoing debate revolves around the choice between pursuing courses aligned with anticipated future demands, particularly in science and technology and opting for subjects of personal interest. This essay seeks to delve into the advantages and drawbacks associated with both perspectives.
In advocating for practicality, some argue that choosing courses aligned with future demands ensures lucrative job opportunities. Graduates with degrees in technology or computer science, for example, currently command substantial salaries due to the increasing need for their expertise in various industries. However, the mandatory nature of these courses may pose challenges for students lacking intrinsic interest, potentially leading to a less fulfilling academic experience.
On the contrary, there is a compelling argument for selecting majors based on personal interest. While these disciplines may not always align with immediate practicality, they often yield long-term benefits. Subjects like arts or cultural studies, despite attracting less attention, provide a rewarding academic experience by fostering engagement and a nuanced understanding of the subject matter. Though securing direct employment in preferred fields may present challenges, the intrinsic motivation derived from studying one's interests enhances the overall university experience.
In conclusion, the ongoing debate between conforming to practical trends or embracing personal academic interests underscores the complexity of decision-making in higher education. While practical courses offer immediate advantages in the job market, the long-term fulfillment derived from pursuing one's passion should not be underestimated. The decision ultimately requires striking a delicate balance between practicality and personal satisfaction, recognizing and weighing the unique advantages and drawbacks of each approach.

The question of whether university students should have the freedom to pursue their preferred subjects or be confined to disciplines with perceived future utility is a contentious issue. Advocates for academic liberty argue that allowing students to study what they are passionate about fosters a love for learning and enhances critical thinking. A diverse education, they contend, produces graduates with a broad skill set, ready to adapt to various challenges. On the contrary, proponents of a more practical curriculum assert that aligning education with the needs of the job market, particularly in science and technology, is imperative.

In my view, a nuanced approach is ideal. While students should be encouraged to explore their interests, universities should also provide avenues for acquiring practical skills. A balance between academic curiosity and real-world applicability ensures that graduates not only have a profound understanding of their chosen fields but also possess the versatility needed in today's dynamic professional landscape.

For instance, a student passionate about literature might develop coding skills, opening up opportunities in digital content creation for tech companies. This integration of diverse knowledge and practical skills makes graduates more competitive in a job market that increasingly values interdisciplinary expertise.

Moreover, a well-rounded education contributes to societal development by fostering a population capable of addressing complex issues from various perspectives. This breadth of understanding is essential for informed decision-making in an interconnected world facing multifaceted challenges.

In conclusion, while academic freedom allows for personal growth and intellectual exploration, a pragmatic approach that integrates practical skills is crucial for preparing graduates to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving job market. The ideal university education combines passion-driven learning with the acquisition of skills that align with the needs of the future, producing graduates who are not only knowledgeable but also adaptable and ready to contribute meaningfully to society.

- be confined to sw/sth: to exist only in a particular area or group of people:
- contentious: causing , involving, or likely to cause disagreement and argument:
- academic liberty
- contend: to say that something is true or is a fact:
- proponent: a person who supports an idea, plan, or cause:
- avenue: a method or way of doing something:
- well-rounded: involving or having experience in a wide range of ideas or activities
- multifaceted: having many different parts or sides:
- pragmatic approach: solving problems in a sensible way that suits the conditions that really exist now, rather than obeying fixed theories, ideas, or rules:
- acquisition of skills

Which subjects should be included in the curriculum at tertiary education seems to be a topic of controversy. While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas related to their future career, I believe that they should be at liberty to study whatever they like.

Some arguments can explain the view of studying subjects such as science and technology, which will be useful in the future. Firstly, these courses will provide more employment opportunities for graduates with better salaries, and therefore, students after graduation can have a higher quality of life. Secondly, society can benefit from a youthful labor source in key subject areas. They are well-educated, creative, and physically strong, which fuels new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity.

However, I believe that choosing which subjects to learn at university should be the freedom of students. If students are passionate about what they are learning, they will pay more attention to lessons and grasp more knowledge and skills. Besides, the freedom to pursue the subjects we like creates a diversity of employees, not only in science and technology but also in art, business, tourism, and other sectors. A healthy economy needs such variety. Finally, nobody can predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills. If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history, and philzosophy than of science or technology.

In conclusion, despite some arguments for the university to force students to study some particular subjects they think useful in years ahead, I advocate the autonomy to choose whichever we like to learn.
