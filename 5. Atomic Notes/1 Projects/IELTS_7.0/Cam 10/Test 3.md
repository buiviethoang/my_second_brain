***Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. 
Do you think this is a positive or negative development? 
***

First draft
```
Internationalization brings people from all corners of the world closer to each other. While this shows several drawbacks, the ability to trade and exchange same kinds of products seems to be a positive development. 
Considering the cons of being internationalized. There are many issues we may encounter. First, due to economical concerns, a flat world facilitated with cross-border influence interferes domestic market in a bad way. For example, people from one nation, despite having trouble buying items far from their proximities, are able to search for the same goods elsewhere. This hinder the buy-and-sell market from local area, dismiss the traditional way of purchasing products rooted from a long time ago. Moreover, travelling and tourism are affected to some extent because the needs for exclusive products will no longer be a pain in the neck. Second, with this trend emerging, national culture faces a real threat when there is no uniqueness from food, products and custom works. As a result, people from all around the world will be easily mistaken countries to countries, because there are no bounder or distinguishable features among them. Therefore, it is important to pay close attention to globalization. 
In contrast, connecting and merging mutually also brings several benefits. As in economy, being similar means more products with ensured quality are sold around the world with no limitation of borders or usages. This reinforces the exporting and importing activities which leads to economical development and reduces inflation rate. Futhermore, the social is granted with more priviledges to achieve higher standard of living. Services are improved and modernised by high quality, some even new tech products which consequently enhance our life as a whole. This also narrow the gap among countries in terms of happiness when the whole will receive the same services, consuming same products and living with the same living conditions. The bright side of internationalization picture seems to outweigh the cons mentioned. 
In conclusion, more beneficial aspects are shown in this developing tendency. Choosing whether to lean towards this trend or not still a decision to make for any country. But the sensible one would possibly opt for the one with more future in it.

In an era marked by unprecedented connectivity and global commerce, the universal accessibility of identical products worldwide has ignited discussions about the evolving nature of countries. This essay will scrutinize the positive and negative dimensions of the increasing similarity among nations due to the widespread availability of the same products, ultimately providing a nuanced perspective.

On the positive side, the global availability of identical products fosters a sense of interconnectedness and shared experiences among nations. This phenomenon signifies a more connected global community, where consumers worldwide can access a diverse range of goods, transcending geographical boundaries. This interconnectedness can be seen as a positive force, promoting cultural exchange and understanding.

However, this trend also carries negative implications, primarily in the realm of cultural diversity. The proliferation of global brands and standardized products may lead to the marginalization of local businesses and traditional practices. This potential erosion of unique cultural identities poses a significant challenge, as the rich tapestry of global cultures risks being overshadowed by a more uniform consumer experience.

Moreover, economic concerns arise, particularly for smaller or developing economies. The dominance of multinational corporations in the global marketplace may hinder local entrepreneurship, leading to economic imbalances and impeding the growth of indigenous industries. Striking a balance between the advantages of a global marketplace and the preservation of unique local identities is crucial to mitigating these challenges.

In conclusion, the global homogenization of countries due to the universal availability of identical products is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative aspects. While it enhances global unity and provides consumers with diverse choices, it also poses risks to cultural diversity and economic autonomy. Achieving a harmonious coexistence of global interconnectedness and cultural diversity requires thoughtful consideration and proactive measures to preserve the unique identities that make each country distinctive.
