### TASK 1 
The two charts illustrates how an Australian household consumes energy and the portion of emitted greenhouse gas originated from this activity. In general, heating include both air and water heating takes up most of the consumption, followed by smaller percentages of other methods in the first chart while gas emissions distribution seems to be a bit different in the second chart. 
Look at the first chart, the largest portion of energy spending is for heating with nearly 45%. Consecutively, water heating is the second most Australian's energy use with 1/3 part of the chart. The others including refrigeration, cooling and lighting account for nearly 15% while the other appliances for the last 15%. 
The second chart shows a minor different distribution. Instead of dominating the portion of the chart, gas from heating results in just 15%, decreasing in 2/3 from the rate of original using. Emission gas of water heating remains nearly the same with approximately 30% of the second chart percentile. There is a general trend with other 3 segment: lighting, refrigeration and other appliances by which they double the percentage in compared with the first chart. 
In conclusion, although heating in general takes large part of consumption from Australian people, gas emission varies differently, showing an inequivalent distribution from the 2 charts.

### TASK 2
***It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early stage. 
Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.
To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 
What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?
***

```ruby - first draft
In a progress of becoming more mature, children at their young age should learn how to steer right from wrong. Although punishment is a handy tool for many parents and teachers, it is not an ultimate solution to educate this group. 
Looking at the bright sight, introducing punishment means easier managing these stubborn, bad-tempered young kids. At early stage, psychologically, children tend to behave in an uncontrolled way. Therefore, fine methods such as detention or physical attempt will play an efficent role to help parents with less effort and more comfortable forcing their children to obey. Moreover, thanks to punishing children by severe actions such as taking away their precious stuff or yelling at them, chances are, children will remember deeply whatever mistakes they make or what bad behaviors they do to never violate again. Those who has been to the situation often carved their memories with the good and the bad they experience. Punishment is a favourite and efficent quick fix to navigate children precisely to determine what is right and wrong. 
However, on the other side of the coin, punishment may be a counter-effective approach towards educating children. First, harsh actions can cause resistence and sometimes depression to the target object. Children can become less cooperative and more self-defense which means the effort to educate them significantly increases. In addition, not so many people like to behave in a forcing way. Punishment results in rivals and rebels amoung children. Moreover, scared memories from the past about mistakes and falsy stuff children had made causes psychological issues. A child living in a disordered state often becomes aggressive and hard to control. Therefore, everything should stay in balance. Too much punishment is not a key to successful education. 
In summary, quick and easy notwithstanding, punishment in teaching kids to learn right from wrong is not a thorough strategy. Adapting to a non-violent, nurturing-oriented approach to educate young children should yield a better outcome.
