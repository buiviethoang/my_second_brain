```
The diagram illustrates how salmons develop from their young ages till they fulfill their life cycles. 
Looking at the picture, three main stages are described, beginning with the breeding of young salmons to their fully growth as large adult individuals.
The first period of the life cycle takes place at several upper rivers with slow water motion. These are where adult salmons lay eggs on the bottom part of some reeds, near the small stones. After about 6 months, many small salmons or 'fry' are born. They then get to the sizes of 3-8 cm in length. 
After the 'fry' are completely hatched, they then moved to the second stage which takes approximately 4 years of their life cycles. At this stage, they are called 'smolt', ranging from 12 to 15 cm length, settle to the fast flowing or lower rivers. The final stage is when the salmons reach their full body sizes of above 70 cm, living in the open sea with other oceanic creatures, ready for the reproduction of next generations.

Title: The Admission Dilemma: Weighing the Pros and Cons of Museum Charges
Introduction:
Museums, as guardians of cultural heritage and repositories of knowledge, play a crucial role in society. However, the question of whether museums should charge admission fees or remain free of charge has been a subject of debate. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of charging people for admission to museums and ultimately weigh which side holds more significance.

Advantages of Charging Admission:

1. **Financial Sustainability:**
    
    - Museums often rely on funding to maintain collections, conduct research, and improve facilities. Charging admission fees provides a valuable source of revenue, ensuring museums can remain financially sustainable.
2. **Quality Maintenance:**
    
    - Admission fees contribute to maintaining and preserving artifacts and artworks. Proper conservation and security measures require financial resources, and charging admission helps museums meet these demands.
3. **Enhanced Visitor Experience:**
    
    - Charging a fee may deter casual visitors, resulting in a more dedicated and engaged audience. Visitors who are willing to pay are likely to value the experience more, leading to a more meaningful interaction with the exhibits.
4. **Promotion of Cultural Value:**
    
    - Paying for admission can be seen as a symbolic gesture that emphasizes the cultural and educational value of museums. This, in turn, fosters a sense of responsibility and appreciation for cultural heritage.

Disadvantages of Charging Admission:

1. **Exclusion of Socioeconomically Disadvantaged:**
    
    - Charging admission may exclude individuals or families with limited financial means, hindering access to cultural and educational resources. This can contribute to social inequality by restricting exposure to art and history based on economic status.
2. **Decreased Accessibility:**
    
    - High admission fees might discourage potential visitors, particularly students and young people. This reduction in accessibility could limit the educational impact of museums and hinder the development of a well-informed society.
3. **Commercialization Concerns:**
    
    - Critics argue that charging admission could lead to the commercialization of museums, with curatorial decisions influenced by the need to attract paying visitors rather than a commitment to educational and cultural values.
4. **Public Perception:**
    
    - Charging fees may result in a perception that museums prioritize profit over public service. This perception could diminish the societal trust and support that museums depend on for their continued existence.

Conclusion:
In weighing the advantages and disadvantages of charging admission to museums, it is evident that both sides carry weighty arguments. Financial sustainability, enhanced visitor experience, and the promotion of cultural value support the case for admission charges. However, concerns about socioeconomic exclusion, decreased accessibility, commercialization, and public perception underscore the importance of considering alternative funding models.
Ultimately, a balanced approach may be the key, where museums utilize a combination of public and private funding to maintain financial stability while ensuring accessibility for diverse audiences. Striking this balance is crucial to fulfilling the dual mandate of museums—to preserve cultural heritage and make it accessible to the widest possible audience, enriching society as a whole.
