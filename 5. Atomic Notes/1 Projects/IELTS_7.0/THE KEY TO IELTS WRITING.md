Intro:
Pursueing happiness has always been a goal to many people throughout their living days. From young ages to adult years, one might seem to enjoy life with different approaches. There are pros and cons at both stages, but living a teenager still brings more happiness than being an adult with lots of responsibilities to be concerned.   
Main: 
For an adult, life may seem to be of great interests. Firstly, because the grownups has built a strong foundation on their careers, they don't face so many challenges as it would be for youngsters financially. 
With abundant amount of money saving from years of work, an adult can enjoy spending money comfortably. In addition, even if their current savings is low due to some certain reason, a good salary that comes from their experienced jobs can facilitate them to live an independent, joyful life. Moreover, an adult with his maturity can overcome problems and deal with difficulties less stressful than it is with a young man who is still in a path of discovering himself. However, grownup people have to tackle with so many issues when responsibilies come to the surface. For example, there are significant number of concerns for a mature one to focus on: from families and friends to colleagues and bussiness partners. This results in a shortage of time for those who are at their adulthood, creating pressures on their shoulders. Thus, life as a grownup person is not as happy as it may sound. 

Within teenage years, there are some obstacles that deter young teens from being happy. Due to lacking of experience in real life, a young teen may find it hard to cope with all problems they may undertake. Plus, with few years of working as employees, they tends to have little to no money to support their independent lives or afford expensive stuff they adore. Nonetheless, in this stage, youngsters have more time to spare so they can spend on meaningful experience and dare to try on new things. This is due to the fact that teens have less responsibilities and little money to be afraid to lose. Even more, many teenagers still receive supports from families and relatives, they don't have to worry much about living an independent life, which is more stressful than ever. Therefore, lacking of many aspects as a teen, life for them seem to be easier and full of joys. 
Conclusion: 
At different stages in life, there is always happiness that comes along. Being a teenager or getting to be a grownup both brings us with many joys. Without putting responsibilities aside, living in a young age is more appealing than jumping right to the adult stuff.
