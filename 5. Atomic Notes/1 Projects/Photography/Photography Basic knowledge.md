## Main

### ISO (International Organization for Standardization)

is a number that measures how sensitive a camera's sensor is to light
- Higher ISO -> more sensitive -> low light shooting only (cause noises & degrade quality, reduce dynamic range)
- Lower ISO -> best for sunny outdoor shoots. 
- Tips: Keep the ISO setting as low as possible, if movement is involved, pair a high ISO with a fast shutter speed

### Aperture
the adjustable opening in the lens that controls the amount of light that enters the camera
Aperture is calibrated in f/stops, which are numbers like 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, and 16

- Lower -> f/stops represent larger apertures -> allow more light into the camera -> more exposure
- Higher -> less light -> the hole is smaller
Also it shows the depth of field
- Lower: Small depth of field
- High f/stop = large depth of field
- Eg: 1 person, focus on her -> f/2. But a group of people -> increase f to f/3.5, f/4.0, ...

### Shutter speed
also known as exposure time, is the length of time a camera's shutter stays open when taking a photo
control motion blur ....
- Slower shutter speed = more motion blur
- Faster shutter speed = less motion blur
