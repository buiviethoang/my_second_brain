#### Product owner
- deciding which features and functionality to build and the order in which to build them
- maintains and communicates to all other participants a clear vision of what the Scrum team is trying to achieve

#### Scrum master
- helps everyone involved understand and embrace the Scrum values, principles, and practices
- helps the organization through the challenging change management process that can occur during a Scrum adoption
- has no authority to exert control over the team, so this role is not the same as the traditional role of project manager or development manager
- The Scrum Master functions as a leader, not a manager
