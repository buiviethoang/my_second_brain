Scrum organizes work in iterations or cycles of up to a calendar month called sprints.
This chapter provides a more detailed description of what sprints are. It then dis-
cusses several key characteristics of sprints: They are timeboxed, have a short and
consistent duration, have a goal that shouldn’t be altered once started, and must reach
the end state specified by the team’s definition of done.

### Timeboxed
Each sprint takes place in
a time frame with specific start and end dates, called a timebox. Inside this timebox,
the team is expected to work at a sustainable pace to complete a chosen set of work
that aligns with a sprint goal.

#### Establishes a WIP Limit
WIP
represents an inventory of work that is started but not yet finished. Failing to prop-
erly manage it can have serious economic consequences. Because the team will plan
to work on only those items that it believes it can start and finish within the sprint,
timeboxing establishes a WIP limit each sprint
#### Forces Prioritization
Timeboxing forces us to prioritize and perform the small amount of work that mat-
ters most. This sharpens our focus on getting something valuable done quickly
#### Demonstrates Progress
by completing and validat-
ing important pieces of work by a known date
#### Avoids Unnecessary Perfectionism
At one time or another we
have all spent too much time trying to get something “perfect” or to do “gold plat-
ing” when “good enough” would suffice
#### Motivates Closure
My experience is that things are more likely to get
done when teams have a known end date. The fact that the end of the sprint brings
with it a hard deadline encourages team members to diligently apply themselves to
complete the work on time
#### Improves Predictability
Although we can’t predict with great certainty
exactly the work we will complete a year from now, it is completely reasonable to
expect that we can predict the work we can complete in the next short sprint

### Short duration

#### Ease of Planning
Short-duration sprints make it easier to plan. It is easier to plan a few weeks’ worth of work than six months’ worth of work. Also, planning on such short time horizons requires far less effort and is far more accurate than longer-horizon planning.
#### Fast feedback  
Rõ ràng thời gian ngắn sẽ giúp phản hồi tức thì hơn. Như thế thì ưu điềm là nếu mà cảm thấy sản phẩm ko tốt -> cắt tỉa luôn, tiết kiệm chi phí mà rất có thể nếu cứ để nguyên, sản phẩm phình to ra thì còn chết nữa. 
#### Improved ROI
Early and more frequent deliverables. -> CÓ NHIỀU cơ hội để tăng revenue -> ROI tăng 
#### Bounded error
Thì rõ ràng, thời gian ngắn thì lỗi có cũng ko nhiều, mà có lỗi thì huỷ cả 1 sprint đi cũng chả vấn đề gì -> Wrong in a small way
#### Rejuvenate excitement 
Vì nó ngắn, mà tâm lý con người lúc nào cũng là muốn nhận phần thưởng nhanh -> quick deliverables -> sướng, muốn làm tiếp, đỡ nản khi mà dự án mãi ko xong. 
#### Frequent checkpoints
Scrum provides managers, stakeholders, product owners, and others with many more checkpoints than they would have with sequential projects. At the end of each short sprint there is a meaningful checkpoint (the sprint review) that allows everyone to base decisions on demonstrable, working features. People are better able to deal with a complex environment when they have more actionable checkpoint opportuni- ties to inspect and adapt.


### Consistent duration
Tức là nếu team đã đồng ý 1 sprint dài 2 tuần -> phải nhất quán đúng 2 tuần ( 2 tuần là 10 ngày làm việc ấy, nếu có ngày lễ chêm vào -> tính đủ 2 tuần ms đúng là 1 sprint)
Kể cả có những lý do nghe rất thuyết phục => Vẫn phải nhất quán.
Nếu ko đủ thời gian hoặc sản phẩm ko lên kịp -> lỗi hệ thống, xem xét lại ở các sprint tiếp sau

#### Cadence benefits
- A steady, healthy heartbeat allows the Scrum team and the organization to acquire an important rhythmic familiarity with when things need to happen to achieve the fast, flexible flow of business value. In my experience, having a regular cadence to sprints enables people to “get into the zone,” “be on a roll,” or “get into a groove.”
-> Kiểu khi đã vào guồng, công việc mỗi sprint nó tương tự nhau nên làm việc rất sướng, chứ nó ko phình to dần như kiểu làm việc kiểu waterfall nhìn mà khiếp 
- Nó cũng giảm tải coordination overhead vì mỗi sprint nó fixed như vậy rồi, dài như nào, mỗi phase cần làm gì, kế hoạch ra sao đều tương tự nhau -> dễ plan các sprints cùng lúc -> ko bị quá tải về sau. 
- Mà nếu có nhiều team phối hợp với nhau, làm việc theo cùng một nhịp độ. thì rất dễ hợp tác, phối hợp cũng mượt mà hơn, ko phải chờ đợi, ko phải pending tasks. 

#### Simplifies planning
When all sprints are the same length (even when they might have a day or less capacity per sprint because of a holiday), the team gets comfortable with the amount of work that it can accomplish in a typical sprint (referred to as its velocity)

If the length of the sprint can vary, we really don’t have a normalized sprint unit. It wouldn’t be meaningful to say things like “The team has an average velocity of 20 points per sprint.

### No Goal-Altering Changes
An important Scrum rule states that once the sprint goal has been established and sprint execution has begun, no change is permitted that can materially affect the sprint goal
#### What Is a Sprint Goal?
Each sprint can be summarized by a sprint goal that describes the business purpose and value of the sprint. Typically the sprint goal has a clear, single focus
During sprint planning, the development team should help refine and agree to the sprint goal and use it to determine the product backlog items that it can complete by the end of the sprint

##### Mutual Commitment
The sprint goal is the foundation of a mutual commitment made by the team and the product owner
The team commits to meeting the goal by the end of the sprint, and the product owner commits to not altering the goal during the sprint.
By defining and adhering to a sprint goal, the Scrum team is able to stay focused (in the zone) on a well-defined, valuable target.
##### Change versus Clarification
Thay đổi là ko thể tránh khỏi, nhưng làm thế nào để deal with it? -> Thêm nó vào backlog thành 1 item sẽ đc thực hiện ở các sprint tiếp sau. 
Thế còn làm rõ (clarification) ? Là những chi tiết thêm vào để làm rõ hơn ý nghĩa chức năng để team dễ phát triển hơn. 
=> Cái này sẽ được team đặt ra các câu hỏi để làm rõ hơn ý nghĩa. => Và đc thực hiện trong sprint đó 

#### Consequences of change

In addition, once we begin sprint execution, our investment in work increases even more as product backlog items transition through the states of to do (work not yet started), doing (work in process), and done (work completed).

In addition to the direct economic consequences of waste, the economics can be indirectly affected by the potential deterioration of team motivation and trust that can accompany a change. When the product owner makes a commitment to not alter the goal and then violates the commitment, the team naturally will be demotivated, which will almost certainly affect its desire to work diligently to complete other prod- uct backlog items. In addition, violating the commitment can harm the trust within the Scrum team, because the development team will not trust that the product owner is willing to stick to his commitments.

#### Being pragmatic
Nếu mà thằng đối thủ sản phẩm nó ngon mà release đúng giai đoạn mà mình đang thực hiện sprint thì sao? Thì lủng? 
Lúc đấy thì phải thực tế lên
As for team motivation and trust, in my experience, when a product owner has a frank, economically focused discussion with the team about the necessity of the change, most teams understand and appreciate the need, so the integrity of motivation and trust is upheld

#### Abnormal termination
Sprint termination is used when an economically significant event has occurred, such as a competitor’s actions that completely invalidate the sprint or product fund- ing being materially changed
Although the product owner reserves the option to cancel each and every sprint, in my experience it is rare that product owners invoke this option
Và trong cái này ý, thì việc mình terminate 1 cái feature trong sprint (thường là ở giữa sprint ms xảy ra vấn đề) ko đáng vì 1 sprints chỉ 3, 4 tuần thôi => Thay vì vậy, vẫn drop cái feature này nhưng mà sẽ dành nguồn lực để sửa những cái lỗi có trong hệ thống cho hết sprints rồi ms sang 1 sprint ms để update new features. 
It is important to realize that terminating the sprint early, in addition to having a negative effect on morale, is a serious disruption of the fast, flexible flow of features and negates many of the benefits of consistent-duration sprints I mentioned earlier. Terminating a sprint should be the last resort
If a sprint is terminated, the Scrum team will have to determine the length of the next sprint: 
1. Staywiththeoriginalsprintlength.Thishastheadvantageofkeepingauni- form sprint length throughout development (except for the terminated sprint, of course). If multiple Scrum teams are collaborating on the same develop- ment effort, using the original sprint length will put the Scrum team that terminated its sprint out of sync with the other teams.
    
2. Make the next sprint just long enough to get to the end date of the termi- nated sprint. For example, if the Scrum team terminated a two-week sprint at the end of the first week, the next sprint would be one week to get the team resynchronized to its original sprint cadence.
    
3. Make the next sprint bigger than a normal sprint to cover the remaining time in the terminated sprint plus the time for the next full sprint. So, in the previous example, make the next sprint three weeks in order to get the team resynchronized to its original sprint cadence.

### Definition of Done
Shipping is a business decision that often occurs at a different cadence; in some organizations it may not make sense to ship at the end of every sprint.Potentially shippable is better thought of as a state of confidence that what got built in the sprint is actually done, meaning that there isn’t materially important undone work (such as important testing or integration and so on) that needs to be completed before we could ship the results from the sprint, if shipping was our busi- ness desire. To determine if what got produced is potentially shippable, the Scrum team must have a well-defined, agreed-upon definition of done.

#### What Is the Definition of Done?
Conceptually the definition of done is a checklist of the types of work that the team is expected to successfully complete before it can declare its work to be potentially shippable
![[Screenshot 2023-09-02 at 08.46.27.png]]

Most of the time, a bare-minimum definition of done should yield a complete slice of product functionality, one that has been designed, built, integrated, tested, and documented and would deliver validated customer value. To have a useful check- list, however, these larger-level work items need to be further refined

Often I am asked, “What if there is a significant defect that remains on the last day of the sprint; is the product backlog item done?” No, it’s not done! And because, as a rule, we don’t extend sprints beyond the end of the planned timebox, we wouldn’t extend the sprint by a day or two to fix the defect in the current sprint. Instead, at the planned end of the sprint, the incomplete product backlog item is taken from the current sprint and reinserted into the product backlog in the proper order based on the other items that are currently in the product backlog. The incomplete item might then be finished in some future sprint.

#### Definition of Done Can Evolve Over Time
You can think of the definition of done as defining the state of the work at the end of the sprint
Many teams, however, start out with a definition of done that doesn’t end in a state where all features are completed to the extent that they could go live or be shipped. For some, real impediments might prevent them from reaching this state at the start of development, even though it is the ultimate goal. As a result, they might (necessarily) start with a lesser end state and let their definition of done evolve over time as organizational impediments are removed

#### Definition of Done versus Acceptance Criteria
The definition of done applies to the product increment being developed during the sprint. The product increment is composed of a set of product backlog items, so each backlog item must be completed in conformance with the work specified by the defi- nition-of-done checklist
So each product backlog item will have its own appropriate set of acceptance criteria. These item-specific criteria are in addi- tion to, not in lieu of, the done criteria specified by the definition-of-done checklist, which apply to all product backlog items.
#### Done versus Done-Done
Some teams have adopted the concept of “done” versus “done-done.” Somehow done- done is supposed to be more done than done!
Defi- nition of done was “I did as much work as I was prepared to do!” So, from that point forward I started using the term done-done, which we both agreed would mean “done to the point where your teacher would think you are done.”
Teams that are unaccustomed to really getting things done early and often are more likely to use done-done as a crutch. For them, using done-done makes the point that being done (doing as much work as they are prepared to do) is a different state from done-done (doing the work required for customers to believe it is done). Teams that have internalized that you can be done only if you did all the work necessary to satisfy customers don’t need to have two states; to them, done means done-done!
