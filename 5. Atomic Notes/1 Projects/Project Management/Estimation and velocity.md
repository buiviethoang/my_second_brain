## What and when we estimate
![[Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 15.13.39.png]]

Most organizations make estimates for planning purposes at three different lev- els of detail. These estimates manifest themselves in the **portfolio backlog**, **product backlog**, and **sprint backlog**.
### Portfolio Backlog Item Estimates
Although the portfolio backlog is not formally a part of Scrum, many organizations maintain one that contains a prioritized list of all of the products (or projects) that need to be built

to estimate portfolio backlog items, many organizations choose to use rough, relative size estimates like T-shirt sizes (such as small, medium, large, extra- large, and so on)
### Product Backlog Estimates
Once a product or project is approved and we start adding more detail to its product backlog items, however, we need to estimate differently
When PBIs have risen in pri- ority and been groomed to include more detail, most teams prefer to put numeric size estimates on them, using either story points or ideal days
