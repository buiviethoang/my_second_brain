## Variability and Uncertainty
### Embrace Helpful Variability
Tức là nếu product mà cứ làm theo kiểu có ý tưởng rõ ràng, các bước để build nó lên thì nó chả khác gì việc manufacturing 1 sản phẩm có sẵn -> Ko có tính mới mẻ. 
Rõ ràng cần phải có những sự biến tấu để cho sản phẩm độc đáo và mới lạ. 

### Employ iterative and incremental development.
Plan-driven, sequential development assumes that we will get things right up front
and that most or all of the product pieces will come together late in the effort => Khó xảy ra trên thực tế. 
Scrum thì: based on iterative and incremental development
- Iterative development acknowledges that we will probably get things wrong
before we get them right and that we will do things poorly before we do them well
- Incremental dev: Build some of it before you build all of it.

### Leverage variability through inspection, adaptation, and transparency.

### Reduce all forms of uncertainty simultaneously
Traditional, sequential development processes focus first on eliminating all end
uncertainty by fully defining up front what is to be built, and only then addressing
means uncertainty.
This simplistic, linear approach to uncertainty reduction is ill suited to the com-
plex domain of product development, where our actions and the environment in
which we operate mutually constrain one another
In Scrum, we do not constrain ourselves by fully addressing one type of uncer-
tainty before we address the next type. Instead, we take a more holistic approach and
focus on simultaneously reducing all uncertainties

Simultaneously addressing multiple types of uncertainty is facilitated
by iterative and incremental development and guided by constant inspection, adapta-
tion, and transparency
## Prediction and adaptation
### Keep Options Open
Plan-driven, sequential development requires that important decisions in areas like
requirements or design be made, reviewed, and approved within their respective
phases. Furthermore, these decisions must be made before we can transition to the
next phase, even if those decisions are based on limited knowledge.
Scrum contends that we should never make a premature decision just because a
generic process would dictate that now is the appointed time to make one. Instead,
when using Scrum, we favor a strategy of keeping our options open. Often this prin-
ciple is referred to as the last responsible moment (LRM) (Poppendieck and Pop-
pendieck 2003), meaning that we delay commitment and do not make important and
irreversible decisions until the last responsible moment. And when is that? When the
cost of not making a decision becomes greater than the cost of making a decision (see
Figure 3.6). At that moment, we make the decision.

### Accept That You Can’t Get It Right Up Front

Plan-driven processes not only mandate full requirements and a complete plan; they
also assume that we can “get it right” up front. The reality is that it is very unlikely
that we can get all of the requirements, or the detailed plans based on those require-
ments, correct up front. What’s worse is that when the requirements do change, we
have to modify the baseline requirements and plans to match the current reality

In Scrum, we acknowledge that we can’t get all of the requirements or the plans
right up front. In fact, we believe that trying to do so could be dangerous because we
are likely missing important knowledge, leading to the creation of a large quantity of
low-quality requirements

With Scrum, we still produce some requirements and plans up front, but just
sufficiently, and with the assumption that we will fill in the details of those require-
ments and plans as we learn more about the product we are building
