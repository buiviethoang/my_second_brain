### What
**Project Management** is the practice of planning, executing, and overseeing a set of tasks to achieve specific goals within defined constraints such as time, budget, and scope.

### 🔧 Core Components

1. **Scope** – What needs to be done?
    
2. **Time** – When does it need to be done?
    
3. **Cost** – What’s the budget?
    
4. **Quality** – Are the deliverables meeting standards?
    
5. **Resources** – Who and what is needed?
    
6. **Communication** – How will updates and information be shared?
    
7. **Risk** – What could go wrong, and how to mitigate it?

### 📌 Common Methodologies

|Methodology|Best For|Key Features|
|---|---|---|
|**Waterfall**|Predictable, sequential projects|Linear phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing|
|**Agile**|Iterative development, software|Sprints, feedback loops, continuous improvement|
|**Scrum**|Small, cross-functional teams|Daily stand-ups, sprints, product backlog|
|**Kanban**|Visual task tracking|Board with To Do → Doing → Done columns|
|**Lean**|Minimizing waste|Continuous delivery and efficiency|
|**PRINCE2**|Government & large enterprise|Structured phases, documentation-heavy|

### 👩‍💼 Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Owns the plan and ensures execution

### Agile vs Scrum

| Aspect             | **Agile**                                                                                                            | **Scrum**                                                                                                    |

#### 📌 Think of it Like This:

- **Agile** is the **"why"** – a **set of values and principles**.
    
- **Scrum** is one of the **"how"** – a **concrete way** to practice Agile.
    

> 🧠 **Analogy**: Agile is like a diet philosophy (e.g., "eat healthy"); Scrum is one specific plan (like keto or intermittent fasting) to follow that philosophy.
