### Health monitoring
## üîç **Why Health Monitoring is Important**

1. **Early Detection of Failures**
    
    - Detect CPU, memory, or disk failures before they affect users.
        
2. **Improved Reliability & Uptime**
    
    - Prevent outages with proactive maintenance.
        
3. **Faster Troubleshooting**
    
    - Pinpoint issues quickly via real-time metrics and logs.
        
4. **Capacity Planning**
    
    - Understand system load to plan for scaling.

|**System Resources**|CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage|
|**Application Health**|Response time, error rate, throughput|
|**Infrastructure**|VM health, container status, node availability|
|**Network**|Latency, packet loss, connection errors|

## üö® **Common Monitoring Patterns**

1. **Health Checks (Liveness & Readiness Probes)**
    
    - Used in Kubernetes & cloud-native environments.
        
    - Liveness = Is it running?
        
    - Readiness = Can it serve traffic?
        
2. **Heartbeat Signals**
    
    - Periodic "I am alive" messages from components.
        
3. **Threshold-based Alerts**
    
    - E.g., Notify if CPU > 85% for 5 minutes.
        
4. **Anomaly Detection**
    
    - Use ML to detect unusual patterns (e.g., sudden traffic spikes).
        

---

## ‚úÖ **Best Practices**

- **Set meaningful SLIs/SLOs** (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
    
- **Monitor from the user's perspective** (end-to-end).
    
- **Automate alerting and escalation**.
    
- **Tag resources and metrics** for traceability.
    
- **Test your monitoring setup** (e.g., simulate failures).
    
- **Visualize trends** with dashboards.

### Availability monitoring
**Availability Monitoring** is a subset of system health monitoring focused specifically on ensuring that **systems, services, and applications are accessible and operational** for end-users. Its primary goal is to detect **downtime or degraded performance** as early as possible.

---

## ‚úÖ **What Is Availability Monitoring?**

It answers the question:

> **"Is the service up and reachable from the user‚Äôs perspective?"**

This includes:

- Uptime vs. downtime
    
- Service responsiveness
    
- Error rates
    
- End-to-end connectivity
    

---

## üìä **Key Metrics for Availability Monitoring**

|Metric|Description|
|---|---|
|**Uptime (%)**|Percentage of time a system is operational (e.g., 99.9%)|
|**Downtime duration**|Time when service was unavailable|
|**Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**|How fast the system detects an outage|
|**Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**|How quickly the issue is resolved|
|**Error rate**|% of failed requests or responses (e.g., 500 errors)|
|**Success rate**|% of successful operations (e.g., HTTP 200)|

---

## üîç **Availability Monitoring Techniques**

|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|**Ping Monitoring**|ICMP ping to check if a host is up|

- Services fail health checks
    
- High response time or high error rate
    
- No heartbeat received within X minutes
    

Integrate with:  
‚Üí **Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Email, SMS**

2. **Set meaningful SLAs/SLOs/SLIs**
    
3. **Monitor dependencies too** (DNS, DB, 3rd-party APIs)
    
4. **Combine synthetic and real monitoring**
    
5. **Automate incident response** where possible
