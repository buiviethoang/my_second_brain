## Main
### What
Threading in Java is about **executing multiple tasks concurrently** within a single program. A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution, and Java provides strong support for multithreading through the `java.lang.Thread` class and the `java.util.concurrent` package.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts

1. **Process vs. Thread**
    
    - **Process**: An independent program with its own memory.
        
    - **Thread**: A lightweight sub-process that shares the same memory space of a process but runs independently.
        
2. **Multithreading**
    
    - Running multiple threads in parallel to improve performance (especially for I/O-bound tasks).
        
    - Example: Handling multiple client requests on a server.


## ðŸ”¹ Thread Lifecycle

A thread goes through these states (`Thread.State` enum):

1. **NEW** â€“ created but not started.
    
2. **RUNNABLE** â€“ ready to run, waiting for CPU.
    
3. **RUNNING** â€“ executing.
    
4. **WAITING / TIMED_WAITING** â€“ paused, waiting for another thread.
    
5. **TERMINATED** â€“ finished execution.

#### Priority
Every Java thread has a priority that helps the operating system determine the order in which threads are scheduled.
Java thread priorities are in the range between MIN_PRIORITY (a constant of 1) and MAX_PRIORITY (a constant of 10). By default, every thread is given priority NORM_PRIORITY (a constant of 5).


## ðŸ”¹ Useful Thread Methods

- `start()` â†’ starts a new thread.
    
- `run()` â†’ contains the code to run (called by JVM).
    
- `sleep(ms)` â†’ pauses the thread.
    
- `join()` â†’ waits for another thread to finish.
    
- `yield()` â†’ hints that the thread is willing to yield CPU.
    
- `interrupt()` â†’ signals a thread to stop.
	

### Thread pools
## What is a ThreadPool?

- A **ThreadPool** manages a group of reusable worker threads.
    
- Instead of creating a new thread for each task, you submit tasks to the pool, and it schedules them for execution.
    
- This improves **performance** (avoids thread creation overhead) and **resource management** (limits max number of threads).

## ðŸ”¹ Executors Utility Class

Java provides the `Executors` factory to create thread pools:
Common factory methods:

- `newFixedThreadPool(n)` â†’ Pool with **n fixed threads**.
    
- `newCachedThreadPool()` â†’ Expands/shrinks as needed, reuses idle threads.
    
- `newSingleThreadExecutor()` â†’ One worker thread, executes tasks sequentially.
    
- `newScheduledThreadPool(n)` â†’ Schedule tasks with delay or periodically.

## ðŸ”¹ Tuning ThreadPools with `ThreadPoolExecutor`

Under the hood, `Executors` returns a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. You can configure it directly:

`ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(         2,      // core pool size         4,      // max pool size         60,     // idle thread timeout         TimeUnit.SECONDS,         new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10) // task queue );`

- **Core pool size** â†’ always alive threads.
    
- **Max pool size** â†’ maximum allowed threads.
    
- **Keep-alive time** â†’ how long extra threads stay alive when idle.
    
- **Work queue** â†’ where waiting tasks are stored.

## ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

âœ… Use a **fixed thread pool** for CPU-bound tasks (size = #cores).  
âœ… Use a **cached pool** for short-lived, I/O-bound tasks.  
âœ… Always **shutdown** the pool to free resources.  
âœ… Consider `CompletableFuture` for async workflows.  
âœ… For production, prefer creating `ThreadPoolExecutor` with custom parameters instead of `Executors` factory (because defaults may not fit).

### Synchronization
When multiple threads access **shared mutable state**, race conditions may occur (e.g., two threads updating the same variable at once).
### âœ… The `synchronized` keyword

It ensures that only **one thread at a time** executes the synchronized block or method.



### Future, CompletableFuture, Async
A `Future<T>` represents the **result of an asynchronous computation**.

- You submit a task (usually a `Callable<T>`) to an `ExecutorService`.
    
- You get back a `Future<T>`.
    
- You can later call `future.get()` to block until the result is ready.

Problem: `Future.get()` **blocks** until result is ready. No easy way to **chain tasks**.

# `CompletableFuture`

Introduced in **Java 8**, it extends `Future` and adds:

- **Non-blocking async callbacks** (like JavaScript Promises).
    
- **Chaining** (`thenApply`, `thenAccept`, `thenCompose`).
    
- **Combining multiple futures** (`allOf`, `anyOf`).

**Async in Java**

Async means **non-blocking execution** â€” tasks run in background threads while main thread continues.


Ways to run async in Java:
ExecutorService + Future
CompletableFuture (preferred)
Custom Executor with CompletableFuture

When to Use What?

- **Future** â†’ simple async result, but blocking. âœ… Good for older Java code.
    
- **CompletableFuture** â†’ modern, async, non-blocking, supports chaining & composition. âœ… Preferred in Java 8+.
    
- **Async with Executor** â†’ fine-grained control over thread pools. âœ… Needed for performance tuning.
