## ExclusionStrategy
A strategy (or policy) definition that is used to decide whether or not a field or top-level class should be serialized or deserialized as part of the JSON output/input. For serialization, if the shouldSkipClass(Class) method returns true then that class or field type will not be part of the JSON output. For deserialization, if shouldSkipClass(Class) returns true, then it will not be set as part of the Java object structure.
## JsonIgnore

## Jackson annotation
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jackson-annotations-for-java-application/
Java has immense application in the coding world, and almost all of us know this fact. One of its features is the Jackson annotations. Although that is a very familiar term with the people involved in the coding world, it is less known. Jackson is a popular and very efficient JAVA library used to map or serialize JAVA objects to JSON and vice versa.
## `Class<?>`
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9921676/what-does-class-mean-in-java
`Class` is a parameterizable class, hence you can use the syntax `Class<T>` where `T` is a type. By writing `Class<?>`, you're declaring a `Class` object which can be of any type (`?` is a wildcard). The `Class` type is a type that contains meta-information about a class.

## spring-boot-configuration-processor
`spring-boot-configuration-processor` is an annotation processor that generates metadata about classes in your application that are annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`. This metadata is used by your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans) to provide auto-completion and documentation for the properties when editing `application.properties` and `application.yaml` files. You can learn a bit more about it in the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata.annotation-processor) of Spring Boot's reference documentation.

## log4j
Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility originally written by Ceki Gülcü. It is part of the Apache Logging Services, a project of the Apache Software Foundation. Log4j is one of several Java logging frameworks. Gülcü has since created SLF4J, Reload4j, and Logback which are alternatives to Log4j

**POM** is an acronym for **Project Object Model**. The pom.xml file contains information of project and configuration information for the maven to build the project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugin, goals etc.
## ant, maven, gradle
https://www.baeldung.com/ant-maven-gradle
Ant build files are written in XML, and by convention, they're called _build.xml_.

Different phases of a build process are called “targets”.

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a dependency management and a build automation tool, primarily used for Java applications. **Maven continues to use XML files just like Ant but in a much more manageable way.** The name of the game here is convention over configuration.

Maven's configuration file, containing build and dependency management instructions, is by convention called _pom.xml_. Additionally, Maven also prescribes a strict project structure, while Ant provides flexibility there as well.

Although Maven has made some serious improvements regarding making application's build processes easier and more standardized, it still comes with a price due to being a lot less flexible than Ant. This lead to the creation of Gradle which combines the best of both worlds – Ant's flexibility and Maven's features.

This was adopted by Gradle, which is using a DSL (Domain-specific language) based either on [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) or [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). **This led to smaller configuration files with less clutter since the language was specifically designed to solve specific domain problems.** Gradle's configuration file is by convention called _build.gradle_ in Groovy, or _build.gradle.kts_ in Kotlin.

## final 
Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.

If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

## DAO

## @Autowired
https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowire
Starting with Spring 2.5, the framework introduced annotations-driven _Dependency Injection_. The main annotation of this feature is _@Autowired__._ **It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean.**
The Spring framework enables automatic dependency injection. In other words, **by declaring all the bean dependencies in a Spring configuration file, Spring container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans**. This is called **_Spring bean autowiring_**.

To use Java-based configuration in our application, let's enable annotation-driven injection to load our Spring configuration
