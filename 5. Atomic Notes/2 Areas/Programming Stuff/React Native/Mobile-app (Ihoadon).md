https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html#testrenderercreate
This package provides a React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.

Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or¬†[jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)

### svg images
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.

SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by the most-used web browsers.

#### ModalDetail
##### RN-gesture-handler
https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/
Gesture Handler aims to replace React Native's built in touch system called Gesture Responder System.

The motivation for building this library was to address the performance limitations of React Native's Gesture Responder System and to provide more control over the built-in native components that can handle gestures. We recommend this talk by Krzysztof Magiera in which he explains issues with the responder system.
##### RN-fetch-blob
https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob
A project committed to making file access and data transfer easier and more efficient for React Native developers.


##### RNFetchBlob.android.actionViewIntent
When sending an ACTION_VIEW intent with given file path and MIME type, system will try to open an App to handle the file. For example, open Gallery app to view an image, or install APK.
##### PermissionAndroid
https://reactnative.dev/docs/permissionsandroid
`PermissionsAndroid`¬†provides access to Android M's new permissions model. The so-called "normal" permissions are granted by default when the application is installed as long as they appear in¬†`AndroidManifest.xml`. However, "dangerous" permissions require a dialog prompt. You should use this module for those permissions.

##### Yup
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup
Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.

Yup's API is heavily inspired by¬†[Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), but leaner and built with client-side validation as its primary use-case. Yup separates the parsing and validating functions into separate steps.¬†`cast()`¬†transforms data while¬†`validate`¬†checks that the input is the correct shape. Each can be performed together (such as HTML form validation) or seperately (such as deserializing trusted data from APIs).

##### Formik
https://formik.org/
Let's face it, forms are really verbose in React. To make matters worse, most form helpers do wayyyy too much magic and often have a significant performance cost associated with them. Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:

Getting values in and out of form state
Validation and error messages
Handling form submission
By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.

##### react-native-text-input-mask
https://blog.logrocket.com/using-input-masks-react-native/
React Native developers often implement various input forms in their mobile applications, which typically contain and accept various input elements and input strings, like names, mobile numbers, dates, times, or postal codes.

Many developers implement input masks with form input elements to add user-friendly input constraints. Input masks are string templates that guide users to enter valid data according to a pre-defined format, usually by blocking invalid keystrokes and displaying the allowed string format as a placeholder. For example, users can only enter numerical digits inside a masked PIN/OTP input box.

https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback
Returns a¬†[memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)¬†callback.

Pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies.¬†`useCallback`¬†will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g.¬†`shouldComponentUpdate`).
#### memoization
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization
In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing.[1] Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling.[2]

#### TypedUseSelectorHook
This interface allows you to easily create a hook that is properly typed for your store's root state.

_@example_
#### Reducer<AppState, AllActionTypes>
A¬†_reducer_¬†(also called a¬†_reducing function_) is a function that accepts an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used to reduce a collection of values down to a single value

Reducers are not unique to Redux‚Äîthey are a fundamental concept in functional programming. Even most non-functional languages, like JavaScript, have a built-in API for reducing. In JavaScript, it's¬†`Array.prototype.reduce()`.

In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous state and an action. They must be¬†_pure functions_‚Äîfunctions that return the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and time travel.

Reducers are the most important concept in Redux.

### ***selectors***
#### Reselect
https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect
Reselect exports a¬†`createSelector`¬†API, which generates memoized selector functions.¬†`createSelector`¬†accepts one or more "input" selectors, which extract values from arguments, and an "output" selector that receives the extracted values and should return a derived value. If the generated selector is called multiple times, the output will only be recalculated when the extracted values have changed.
### ***types***
#### Why immutable.js? 
https://grapeup.com/blog/benefits-of-using-immutable-js-with-react-redux-apps/#
Before using Immutable.js, the biggest issue with the Redux library often comes to returning a new object, which is nested in another object. In this case, using the Object.assign and spread operator syntax is not readable and may increase app complexity.

Some may suggest keeping your reducer‚Äôs state as flat as possible. That could be right, but sometimes, even if your state is flat, you would have to set something in a nested object. So, if you also struggle because of that, the immutable library comes to make your life easier
#### Record - Immutatble.js
https://gist.github.com/jareware/5f492d47fae45d577e922c431c267c67
Immutable.js provides a beautiful,¬†[Clojure-inspired](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/#javascript-first-api)¬†API for dealing with abstract Collections and Sequences, and several concrete data structures that implement that API, such as Lists, Maps and so on. The only ugly spot, so to speak, on the API is accessing Map values. With traditional JS objects, you're used to going:

const bear = { sound: 'growl' }
bear.sound // => 'growl'

But with Immutable.Map -- the thing you get when converting directly from JS to Immutable -- it's not as convenient:

import { fromJS } from 'immutable'
const bear = fromJS({ sound: 'growl' })
bear.sound // => undefined
bear.get('sound') // => 'growl'

That¬†`.get()`¬†stuff is somewhat awkward syntax for something that you'll be doing¬†**a lot**¬†across your codebase, especially as JS devs are used to the convenience of simply dot-accessing properties of objects.

Records bridge this convenience gap in property access:

import { Record } from 'immutable'
const Animal = Record({
  sound: 'unknown' // this is the default value if no 'sound' is set
})
const bear = new Animal({
  sound: 'growl'
})
bear.sound // => 'growl'
bear.get('sound') // => 'growl'

#### List - Immutable
You can create a List of data using either the¬†`List()`¬†constructor, or the¬†`List.of()`¬†method, depending on the type of data you‚Äôre using to create the List:

-   `List.of()`¬†‚Äì use when creating a List from non-iterable data (e.g. a set of function arguments, a JavaScript object, or a string you want interpreted as a whole string);
-   `List()`¬†‚Äì use when creating a List from iterable data (e.g. an array, or an Immutable Iterable object (List, Map, Set, etc.), or a string that you want interpreted as a series of characters).

_**Important:**¬†a JavaScript string is an¬†[iterable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#Builtin_iterables "JavaScript iterables"), so if you create a List of strings using¬†`List("string")`, you‚Äôll actually get a List of characters (`['s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']`). To make Immutable interpret a string as a non-iterable value, use¬†`List.of("string")`¬†instead. See the examples below._

Immutable‚Äôs List constructors only create a List from a the top level of an Array. This means that a nested array will be turned into an Immutable List of arrays, whereas you might prefer a List of Lists.

To ensure all nested arrays are converted to Immutable Lists, use the¬†`Immutable.fromJS()`¬†function

##  ***types***
### type alias
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases
We‚Äôve been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations. This is convenient, but it‚Äôs common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A¬†_type alias_¬†is exactly that - a¬†_name_¬†for any¬†_type_
### enum
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html
Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

### typeof
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html
The¬†`keyof`¬†operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys. The following type P is the same type as ‚Äúx‚Äù | ‚Äúy‚Äù

type Point = { x: number; y: number };

type P = keyof Point;

#### Element finder
https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ElementFinder
The ElementFinder simply represents a single element of an ElementArrayFinder (and is more like a convenience object). As a result, anything that can be done with an ElementFinder, can also be done using an ElementArrayFinder.

The ElementFinder can be treated as a WebElement for most purposes, in particular, you may perform actions (i.e. click, getText) on them as you would a WebElement. Once an action is performed on an ElementFinder, the latest result from the chain can be accessed using the then method. Unlike a WebElement, an ElementFinder will wait for angular to settle before performing finds or actions.

ElementFinder can be used to build a chain of locators that is used to find an element. An ElementFinder does not actually attempt to find the element until an action is called, which means they can be set up in helper files before the page is available.

Run linters against staged git files and don't let¬†![hankey](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a9.png)¬†slip into your code base!
Linting makes more sense when run before committing your code. By doing so you can ensure no errors go into the repository and enforce code style. But running a lint process on a whole project is slow, and linting results can be irrelevant. Ultimately you only want to lint files that will be committed.

This project contains a script that will run arbitrary shell tasks with a list of staged files as an argument, filtered by a specified glob pattern.

### react-native-svg-transformer
https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer
React Native SVG transformer allows you to import SVG files in your React Native project the same way that you would in a Web application when using a library like SVGR to transform your imported SVG images into React components.
This makes it possible to use the same code for React Native and Web.
# **package.json**
https://instamobile.io/react-native-tutorials/full-clean-react-native-project/
Usually, you want to fully clean your project if you:

-   Ran a project on your machine that was in a different React Native version (to avoid the React Native Mistmatch error)
-   Ran the same project previously, but in a different React Native version
-   Bumped up package versions in the¬†**_package.json_**¬†file
-   Modified¬†**_ios/Podfile_**
-   Opened the metro bundler in the wrong folder
-   Changed your codebase to point to a different Firebase project
-   Encounter build issues in Xcode or Android Studio

Fully removing the cache of your React Native environment is a good way to clean out your build after some time running the project so that you are sure¬†your build includes only the most up-to-date files based on your source code.

# **tsconfig.json**
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html
The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.
JavaScript projects can use a jsconfig.json file instead, which acts almost the same but has some JavaScript-related compiler flags enabled by default.
A project is compiled in one of the following ways:
Using tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json
By invoking tsc with no input files, in which case the compiler searches for the tsconfig.json file starting in the current directory and continuing up the parent directory chain.
By invoking tsc with no input files and a --project (or just -p) command line option that specifies the path of a directory containing a tsconfig.json file, or a path to a valid .json file containing the configurations.
When input files are specified on the command line, tsconfig.json files are ignored.
### paths: 
https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths
A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the baseUrl. There is a larger coverage of paths in the handbook.

paths lets you declare how TypeScript should resolve an import in your require/imports.
