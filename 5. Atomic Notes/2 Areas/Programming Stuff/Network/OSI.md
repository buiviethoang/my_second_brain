## Main

Open Systems Interconnection
7 layers
- Physical layer: bits -> devices (Hub / Modem / Repeater)
- Data link layer: Framing mess -> MAC, Flow control (Switches & Bridges)
- Network layer: Packet -> Ip address , Routing (Router & Switch)
- Transport layer: Segments -> TCP, UDP , Segmenting
- Session layer: Connections -> session establishment, sync
- Presentation layer: Formatted data -> JPEG, MPEG, TLS/SSL , Translation
- Application layer: Real data -> SMTP, FTP, DNS, ..

### Process
- ****Application Layer:**** Applications create the data.
- ****Presentation Layer:**** Data is formatted and encrypted.
- ****Session Layer:**** Connections are established and managed.
- ****Transport Layer:**** Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
- ***Network Layer:*** Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
- ****Data Link Layer:**** Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
- ****Physical Layer:**** Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.
