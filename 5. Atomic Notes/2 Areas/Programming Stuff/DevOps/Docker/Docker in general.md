## Main

## Architecture
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker _client_ talks to the Docker _daemon_, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon _can_ run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

### The Docker daemon
The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
### The Docker client
The Docker client (`docker`) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as `docker run`, the client sends these commands to `dockerd`, which carries them out. The `docker` command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.
### Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (`dockerd`), the Docker client (`docker`), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
### Docker registries
A Docker _registry_ stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the `docker push` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.

### Docker objects
#### Images
An _image_ is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is _based on_ another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the `ubuntu` image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run
#### Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
