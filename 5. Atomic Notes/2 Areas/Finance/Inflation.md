### What? 
**Inflation** is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises over time, decreasing the **purchasing power** of money.

> 🔥 If inflation is 5%, then something that costs $100 today will cost $105 next year — and your $100 will buy **less**.

### 🎯 Real Return vs Nominal Return

Let’s say your investment returns **6%**, but inflation is **4%**:

- **Nominal return** = 6%
    
- **Real return** = 6% - 4% = **2%**
    

Always consider **real returns** — they reflect how much your money actually grows in purchasing power.


### 🛡️ How to Protect Against Inflation

1. **Invest in real assets**:
    
    - Real estate, commodities, and REITs tend to hold value.
        
2. **Buy inflation-protected securities**:
    
    - U.S. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
        
3. **Focus on stocks with pricing power**:
    
    - Companies that can raise prices during inflation (e.g., consumer staples).
        
4. **Avoid holding too much cash**:
    
    - It loses value every day during inflation.

### How to calculate? 

#### ✅ **1. Measure the CPI (Consumer Price Index)**

The **CPI** tracks the average price changes of a basket of goods and services over time, including:

- Food and beverages
    
- Housing and construction materials
    
- Transportation
    
- Education
    
- Healthcare
    
- Clothing
    
- Utilities
    
- Telecommunications
    
- Culture and entertainment
    

Each item in the basket has a **weight** based on its share of average household spending.

#### ✅ **2. Use the CPI to Calculate Inflation**

The formula is:

Inflation rate (%)=CPIcurrent−CPIpreviousCPIprevious×100\text{Inflation rate (\%)} = \frac{\text{CPI}_{\text{current}} - \text{CPI}_{\text{previous}}}{\text{CPI}_{\text{previous}}} \times 100Inflation rate (%)=CPIprevious​CPIcurrent​−CPIprevious​​×100

For example:

- CPI in July 2025: **110.2**
    
- CPI in July 2024: **106.8**
    

Inflation=110.2−106.8106.8×100≈3.18%\text{Inflation} = \frac{110.2 - 106.8}{106.8} \times 100 \approx 3.18\%Inflation=106.8110.2−106.8​×100≈3.18%



### Affect to assets
| Asset Class          | Inflation Impact                         | Why?                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cash**             | ❌ Very Negative                          | Value erodes directly — you're losing purchasing power.                                      |
| **Bonds**            | ❌ Often Negative (especially fixed-rate) | Fixed interest payments lose real value. Inflation-linked bonds (e.g., TIPS) are exceptions. |
| **Stocks**           | ✅ Mixed/Neutral-Positive (long term)     | Companies can raise prices, but high inflation can hurt profits and cause volatility.        |
| **Real Estate**      | ✅ Positive                               | Property values and rents often rise with inflation.                                         |
| **Gold/Commodities** | ✅ Hedge Potential                        | Seen as stores of value; often rise when inflation is high.                                  |
| **Cryptocurrencies** | ❓ Highly Variable                        | Some see Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, but it’s still speculative and volatile.             |
