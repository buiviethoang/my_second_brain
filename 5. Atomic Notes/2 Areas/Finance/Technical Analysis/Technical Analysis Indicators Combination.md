Here’s a chart snippet of AAPL (Apple Inc.) to combine the price with three key technical indicators — **Bollinger Bands**, **MACD**, and **RSI**.

### 🔍 How to interpret this setup:

- The Bollinger Bands give you a **volatility envelope** around the price: a middle moving average plus an upper and lower band at (typically) ±2 standard deviations.
    
- The MACD shows the difference between a fast and slow EMA (e.g., 12-period vs 26-period) plus a signal line, helping identify trend changes and momentum shifts.
    
- The RSI tracks momentum on a bounded 0-100 scale (often with thresholds at 70 and 30) indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    

When you **combine all three** for a stock like Apple, you get a richer signal:

- Price touching or breaching the **Bollinger upper band** while RSI > 70 might signal an overbought condition.
    
- If simultaneously the MACD histogram is shrinking (momentum fading) or MACD crosses below its signal line, that adds further weight to a potential reversal.
    
- Conversely, price near the **lower Bollinger band**, RSI < 30, and MACD turning up can be a bullish setup.

### ✅ Example usage with AAPL:

Since the most recent data shows Apple’s price around **~$262.82** [Yahoo Tài Chính+2Yahoo Tài Chính+2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?utm_source=chatgpt.com):

- If you see the price moving toward the upper Bollinger Band while MACD is positive and rising → suggests strong upward momentum, possible continuation.
    
- If you see the price hitting the upper band but the MACD histogram stops rising (or MACD crosses downward) + RSI is high → watch for a potential pull-back.
    
- If the price is near the lower band, MACD is turning up, and RSI is low → possible rebound.
