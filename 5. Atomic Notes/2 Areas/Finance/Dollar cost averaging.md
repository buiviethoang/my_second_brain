### DCA

**Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)** is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset's price. Over time, this approach spreads out your purchase prices and reduces the risk of investing a large amount at the wrong time.


### âœ… How It Works:

Letâ€™s say you invest **$100 every month** into a stock or crypto:

|Month|Price per Share|Shares Bought|Total Shares|
|---|---|---|---|
|Jan|$10|10.00|10.00|
|Feb|$20|5.00|15.00|
|Mar|$5|20.00|35.00|

- Total Invested: $300
    
- Average Share Price: ($10 + $20 + $5) / 3 = $11.67 (simple average)
    
- **Your effective cost per share**: $300 / 35 shares = **$8.57**
    

Even though prices varied, you bought more shares when the price was low and fewer when high, averaging out the cost effectively.


### ðŸŽ¯ Why Use DCA?

- **Reduces timing risk**: No need to guess the market top or bottom.
- **Builds discipline**: Encourages regular investing.
- **Good for volatile assets**: Especially useful in crypto or tech stocks.
- **Less emotional investing**: Automates decisions and avoids panic buying/selling.


### Lump sum

**Lump-Sum Investing** is a strategy where you invest **all your available capital at once**, rather than spreading it out over time (like in Dollar Cost Averaging).

### âœ… How It Works:

Letâ€™s say you have **$1,200 to invest**:

- With **lump-sum investing**, you invest the entire $1,200 **today**.
- With **DCA**, you might invest $100 every month for 12 months.

If the market goes up soon after your lump-sum investment, you benefit immediately. But if the market crashes right after, you absorb the full impact.

### ðŸŽ¯ When Lump-Sum May Be Better:
- **Youâ€™re investing in a growing market**: Historically, markets trend upward over time, so being in the market sooner usually outperforms waiting.
- **You already have the full amount ready**: No need to wait for future cash flow.
- **You have a long time horizon**: Short-term dips matter less if you're investing for 10+ years.


|Feature|Lump-Sum|Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)|
|---|---|---|
|Risk|Higher (upfront exposure)|Lower (spread out over time)|
|Historical return|Often higher|More stable, less volatile|
|Emotional comfort|Can be stressful|Easier psychologically|
|Best for|Bull markets, long term|Volatile or uncertain markets|
