## Main
A **firewall** is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. Its main purpose is to act as a barrier between a trusted internal network (like your companyâ€™s LAN) and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

### ðŸ”‘ Core Functions of a Firewall

1. **Traffic Filtering** â€“ Allows or blocks packets based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, or application-level rules.
    
2. **Access Control** â€“ Defines which devices or services can communicate.
    
3. **Monitoring & Logging** â€“ Tracks network activity for auditing and detecting suspicious behavior.
    
4. **Intrusion Prevention** â€“ Some firewalls can detect and block malicious patterns in real time.

### Types of Firewalls
- **Packet-Filtering Firewall (Stateless)**
    
    - Checks packets against a set of rules (IP, port, protocol).
        
    - Fast but limited â€” cannot track connection state.
        
- **Stateful Inspection Firewall**
    
    - Keeps track of active connections.
        
    - Can make decisions based on the state of a connection (e.g., allowing only responses to internal requests).
        
- **Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Gateway)**
    
    - Acts as an intermediary between users and services.
        
    - Can inspect application traffic (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.) for deeper security.
        
- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**
    
    - Combines traditional firewall with advanced features like **deep packet inspection (DPI)**, intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS), and application awareness.
        
- **Cloud/Software Firewalls**
    
    - Deployed in cloud environments or host-based (on individual servers or device
