### What
**Agile** is a **project management philosophy** that promotes **adaptive planning**, **early delivery**, **continuous improvement**, and **flexible responses to change**. It's ideal for **complex, evolving projects** â€“ especially in **software development**, but widely used across industries today.

### ## ðŸ“œ Agile Manifesto (2001)

Created by 17 software developers, the Agile Manifesto lays out **4 core values**:

|We value **more**|over|
|---|---|
|Individuals and interactions|Processes and tools|
|Working software|Comprehensive documentation|
|Customer collaboration|Contract negotiation|
|Responding to change|Following a plan|

And **12 principles**, some key ones include:

- Deliver working software **frequently** (weeks, not months)
    
- Welcome **changing requirements**, even late
    
- Work closely with **customers**
    
- Build projects around **motivated individuals**
    
- Reflect and adjust **regularly**

### ðŸ§  Why Agile?

Traditional "Waterfall" methods are rigid and slow to adapt. Agile solves this by being:

|Benefit|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Flexible**|Embraces change, even late in the project|
|**Customer-centric**|Involves customer feedback early and often|
|**Fast delivery**|Delivers usable features regularly|
|**Risk reduction**|Problems discovered early through iteration|
|**Transparency**|Progress is visible through sprints/boards|
|**Team empowerment**|Teams decide how best to do the work|

### ðŸ”§ Popular Agile Frameworks

Agile is a mindset. It can be applied via **frameworks**, including:

| Framework                         | Key Feature                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrum**                         | Fixed sprints, defined roles (PO, SM, Dev)      |
| **Kanban**                        | Visual board, flow-focused, no fixed iterations |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)**      | Engineering-focused (pair programming, TDD)     |
| **Lean**                          | Eliminate waste, optimize the whole system      |
| **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** | For large enterprises to adopt Agile at scale   |
