### HTTP request methods
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Methods play a significant role in API design. They define the type of request a client can make to a server, providing the framework for interaction between client and server. Understanding HTTP methods is paramount to creating a robust and effective API. Some of the common HTTP methods used in API design include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. Each of these methods signifies a different type of request, allowing for various interactions with your API endpoints. This in turn creates a more dynamic, functional, and user-friendly API.
